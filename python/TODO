# General:
   Now: 
    - Style:
      - replace "` -" with "`:" for docstring consistency
      - format all docstrings properly. (with args and all). separate args with 2 newlines. Change 'Args' to 'Params'
      - Make all imports alphabetical
    - update __main__.py in gerrymandering
    - make it a package so we can install it and all the imports will come from hacking_the_election
   Later:
    - Predict errors and create custom exceptions to throw in those cases
    - speed up with cython and c++ extensions (may have to be done before fair if code is too slow)
    - update unit tests and make them actually pass

# Serialization:
   Later (Possible after project):
    - update unit tests

# Communities:
   Now:
    - use threading during community filling process
    - do something about 372 in utils.py throwing a valueerror
    - continue working on partisanship test
    - alphabetize functions in utils package
    - write make_communities function in __init__.py
   Later:
    - Add formal psuedo-code to communities package docstring
