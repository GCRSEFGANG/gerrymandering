# General:
   Now: 
    - Style:
      - replace "` -" with "`:" for docstring consistency
      - format all docstrings properly. (with args and all). separate args with 2 newlines. Change 'Args' to 'Params'
      - Make all imports alphabetical
    - update __main__.py in gerrymandering
   Later:
    - Predict errors and create custom exceptions to throw in those cases
    - Fill __init__.pys with __version__s and make pypi package
    - speed up with cython and c++ extensions (may have to be done before fair if code is too slow)
    - update unit tests and make them actually pass

# Serialization:
   Later (Possible after project):
    - update unit tests

# Communities:
   Now:
    - use threading during community filling process
    - go back two steps if line 372 in utils.py throws a valueerror
    - continue working on partisanship test
    - make communities algorithm into package
