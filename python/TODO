# General:
   Now:
    - replace "` -" with "`:" for docstring consistency
    - format all docstrings properly. (with args and all). separate args with 2 newlines. Change 'Args' to 'Params'
    - Make all imports alphabetical
   Later:
    - Predict errors and create custom exceptions to throw in those cases
    - Fill __init__.pys with __version__s and make pypi package
    - speed up with cython and c++ extensions (may have to be done before fair if code is too slow)

# Serialization:
   Later (Possible after project):
    - update unit tests

# Communities:
   Now:
    - write communities algorithm
    - update step 1 to accept states with islands
    - fix style issues with code in utils.py and communities.py
    - update docstrings for community algorithm functions
    - continue working on partisanship test
    - Make utils a package with modules having functions and classes required for each step of the algorithm and general.
