# General:
   Now:
    - replace "` -" with "`:" for docstring consistency
    - format all docstrings like get_nearest_island_precinct in gerrymandering.utils
   Later:
    - Predict errors and create custom exceptions to throw in those cases
    - Fill __init__.pys with __version__s and make pypi package
    - speed up with cython and c++ extensions (may have to be done before fair if code is too slow)

# Serialization:
   Now:
    - serialize all data from raw directory in data repo
   Later (Possible after project):
    - update unit tests

# Communities:
   Now:
    - write communities algorithm
    - update step 1 to accept states with islands

# Quantification:
	- write algorithm
