# Serialization:
   Now:
    - serialize all data from raw directory in data repo
    - create script to convert pickled precinct objects to json and test with gui.cpp
   Later (Possible after project):
    - change save_precincts.py so that there needs to be no input but the state and election and geodata filepaths
    - update unit tests and add test data
