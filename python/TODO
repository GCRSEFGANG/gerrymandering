# General:
   Now:
    - make serialization, loading, and communities algorithm work from command-line
   Later:
    - Predict errors and create custom exceptions to throw in those cases

# Serialization:
   Now:
    - change load_precincts.py to take a single file path as an input
    - remove useless imports and move import sys to top of file in save_precincts.py
    - serialize all data from raw directory in data repo
    - create script to convert pickled precinct objects to json and test with gui.cpp
   Later (Possible after project):
    - update unit tests and add test data

# Communities:
   Now:
    - create utils file filled with geometry algorithms for useful stuff
