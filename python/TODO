# General:
   Now: 
    - Style:
      - replace "` -" with "`:" for docstring consistency
      - format all docstrings properly. (with args and all). separate args with 2 newlines. Change 'Args' to 'Params'
      - Make all imports alphabetical
    - update __main__.py in gerrymandering
    - use numpy arrays within shapely objects
    - move custom exceptions to exceptions.py
   Later:
    - Predict errors and create custom exceptions to throw in those cases
    - speed up with cython and c++ extensions (may have to be done before fair if code is too slow)
    - update unit tests and make them actually pass

# Serialization:
   Now:
    - serialize New York
   Later (Possible after project):
    - update unit tests
    - serialize all states

# Communities:
   Now:
    - move Community class to its own file in utils.py
    - continue working on partisanship test
    - write make_communities function in __init__.py
    - add much datas to return in partisanship
    - figure out how to overhaul standard deviation so it makes sense in partisanship
    - update communities_to_json so it creates new json at every precinct change or literally whatever
