"""Unit tests for the `hacking_the_election.utils` subpackage

These are the lowest level functions in the `hacking_the_election` package,
and therefore these tests passing is crucial to the functionality of the entire package.

Run with `python3 -m hacking_the_election test utils`, after installing `hacking_the_election`, as described in the README.
