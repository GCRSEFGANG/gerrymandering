# Documentation
A directory dedicated to documenting our open-source battle with gerrymandering.

## Algorithms
If you want detailed explanations of our algorithms, try the `algorithm/` subdirectory.
Contains information on:
- [Iterative poltical community generation](https://github.com/hacking-the-election/gerrymandering/docs/algorithm/communities.md)
- [Redistricting approach](https://github.com/hacking-the-election/gerrymandering/docs/algorithm/communities.md#Redistricting)
- [Quantification of gerrymandering]((https://github.com/hacking-the-election/gerrymandering/docs/algorithm/gerrymandering.md))

## Data
Our data was gathered from various sources. Please look to the repository located at [hacking-the-election/data](https://github.com/hacking-the-election/data), where information about sources, location, and type of data can be found.

We have compiled this data source into serialized binary files for use in both Python and C++. These can be found in the `/bin/` directory in the data repository. They contain objects for lightweight data handling.
