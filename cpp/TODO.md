# TODO
For the list of everything C++ related I need to do right now.

# Serializing
- Don't fix district inheritance issue until after serializing (make district a `Shape`, not `Precinct_Group`).
- Use better structure with `Multi_Polygon` class

# Geometric Function
### Random Generation
- Fix outer shell algorithm, base `boundary_precincts` alorithm off of it.
- Add body for `get_addable_precinct` - implementation of step 1 precinct iteration
